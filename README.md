### 📝 Description
Contains a collection of my weekly workshop solutions. <br>
The workbook (PDF) containing most of the workshop writeups from each week cannot be uploaded due to Pluralsight ownership rights. <br>
The instructor's versions of these workshop solutions can be found [here](https://github.com/BrightBoost/learningjava/tree/main/src/main/java/com/pluralsight) (given that the repo is still active) <br>

#### 🔖 Citation
I wrote this README.md, but I did indeed use ChatGPT to give my initial framework and to learn markdown formatting. Therefore here is an APA Style Citation for it:  <br>
OpenAI. (2025). ChatGPT (Oct 1 version) [Large language model]. https://chatgpt.com/ <br>

*I have to give credit where it's due, right?* <br>
