### üìù Description
Contains a collection of my weekly workshop solutions. <br>
The workbook (PDF) containing most of the workshop writeups from each week cannot be uploaded due to Pluralsight ownership rights. <br>
The instructor's versions of these workshop solutions can be found [here](https://github.com/BrightBoost/learningjava/tree/main/src/main/java/com/pluralsight) (given that the repo is still active). <br>
Most of the instructor's workshop solutions should be titled 'workshop' or include that in the folder or filename. <br>

### üí≠ My Thoughts: <br>
#### Week/Workshop 1
- **Workshop Title:** Financial Calculators
- **Program(s) Description:** Calculates and displays results for 3 different financial annuity calculators: mortgage, present value, and future value.
  - **Thoughts:** This workshop created a lot of discipline within me for properly understanding PEMDAS (the order of mathematical operations) via the usage/pairing of parenthesis in mathematical expressions & calculations in Java. This is primarily due to having to implement multiple mathematical formulas which are easily written on paper, but become more complex to write (and interpret) in Java code form.

#### üîñ Citation
I wrote this README.md, but I did indeed use ChatGPT to give my initial framework and to learn markdown formatting. Therefore here is an APA Style Citation for it:  <br>
OpenAI. (2025). ChatGPT (Oct 1 version) [Large language model]. https://chatgpt.com/ <br>

*I have to give credit where it's due, right?* <br>
